Building Your First Microscope
==============================


Step 1: Installing Python and ScopeFoundry
------------------------------------------

[anaconda_dl]: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Note: We recommend the [Anaconda][anaconda_dl] Python distribution, which contains many easy-to-install scientific python packages.

* Download and Install [Anaconda][anaconda_dl]. The recommended Python version is 3.5, but 2.7 will also work. If you already had a non-Anaconda version of python installed, you will need to make sure you use Anaconda if you would like to follow the instructions below.

* Anaconda provides a way to make a clean set of packages in an "environment". Follow these steps to create an [conda environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html). This environment includes ScopeFoundry and all of the packages ScopeFoundry needs to run. 

    #### Windows
    
    Open an Anaconda prompt and run the following commands:
    
    ```cmd
    > conda create -n scopefoundry python=3.5
    > activate scopefoundry
    (scopefoundry) > conda install numpy pyqt qtpy h5py
    (scopefoundry) > pip install pyqtgraph
    (scopefoundry) > conda install git  
    (scopefoundry) > pip install git+git://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry.git
    ```
    The first two lines create and activate a clean python / conda environment for your ScopeFoundry app to use, the next lines install the required packages and the final line install the ScopeFoundry package itself.    

    #### Mac/Linux

    Open a terminal and run the following commands:

    ```
    $ conda create -n scopefoundry python=3.5
    $ source activate scopefoundry
    (scopefoundry) $ conda install numpy pyqt qtpy h5py
    (scopefoundry) $ pip install pyqtgraph
    (scopefoundry) $ pip install git+git://github.com/ScopeFoundry/ScopeFoundry.git
    ```	

    The first two lines create and activate a clean python / conda environment for your ScopeFoundry app to use, the next lines install the required packages and the final line install the ScopeFoundry package itself.   


Step 2: Create your Microscope App
----------------------------------

[fancy_microscope_app.py]: building_your_first_microscope_tutorial/fancy_microscope_app.py

Make a directory (folder) for you microscope, say `fancy_microscope`, and create a file inside called `fancy_microscope.py`(A complete version of this file is available [here][fancy_microscope_app.py]). Copy and paste the following content into this file and save it.

This file tells ScopeFoundry all about your microscope -- like any hardware and measurement components that are part of your microscope setup. 

ScopeFoundry assumes a few basic things about your microscope, but not many. The basic assumptions it makes are part of `BaseMicroscopeApp` python class, which we import here.

When you define your microscope app, `FancyMicroscopeApp`, it inherits from its parent class, `BaseMicroscopeApp`. You then you add your own bells and whistles in your `setup()` method. The code below has comments about what we can do during setup, but so far is left blank.

If you run this file as a python script, the last few lines tell python to create an instance of `FancyMicroscopeApp` and then run it.


```python
from ScopeFoundry import BaseMicroscopeApp

class FancyMicroscopeApp(BaseMicroscopeApp):

    # this is the name of the microscope that ScopeFoundry uses 
    # when storing data
    name = 'fancy_microscope'
    
    # You must define a setup function that adds all the 
    #capablities of the microscope and sets default settings
    def setup(self):
        
        #Add App wide settings
        
        #Add hardware components
        print("Adding Hardware Components")

        #Add measurement components
        print("Create Measurement objects")

        # Connect to custom gui
        
        # load side panel UI
        
        # show ui
        self.ui.show()
        self.ui.activateWindow()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    
    app = FancyMicroscopeApp(sys.argv)
    sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

Let's test our empty microscope app:

in your terminal window: `python fancy_microscope_app.py` and you will be greeted something like this:

![Image of empty microscope](empty_microscope.png)


In the next step we'll tell you how to add some pre-built bells and whistles to make this more useful. (Yes, we know, you want custom ones. We'll teach you how to do that, too!)


Step 3: Install hardware and measurement components
---------------------------------------------------
[scopefoundry-github]: http://github.com/ScopeFoundry/

Now, we will learn how to add piece of hardware to your microscope. We have a virtual function generator that acts like an analog input attached to a function generator that makes sine and square waves. Let's install this package which is available on the [ScopeFoundry GitHub][scopefoundry-github] project:

```
(scopefoundry) $ pip install git+git://github.com/ScopeFoundry/HW_virtual_function_gen.git
```

Now python has access to the functions and modules provided by this package.

### Hardware Component

Add the hardware component to your microscope app by adding these lines to your app's `setup()` function:

```python
    def setup(self):
        ...
        #Add Hardware components
        from ScopeFoundryHW.virtual_function_gen.vfunc_gen_hw import VirtualFunctionGenHW
        self.add_hardware(VirtualFunctionGenHW(self))
        ...   
```
We need two lines in the setup function to use this hardware component. The first line tells python where to find the hardware component, via an `import` statement. The next line creates an instance of the hardware (an active copy in memory), and then adds it to your App.

Notice that ScopeFoundry Hardware components always have the suffix "HW".

### Measurement Component

The `virtual_function_gen` package also provides a way to capture the data, display and save the data from the our new hardware component. This is encapuslated in a ScopeFoundry `Measurement` class. Let's include a `sine_wave_plot` measurement in our App by adding a couple lines to our `setup()` function:

```python
    def setup(self):
        ...
        #Add Measurement components
        from ScopeFoundryHW.virtual_function_gen.sine_wave_measure import SineWavePlotMeasure
        self.add_measurement(SineWavePlotMeasure(self))
        ...
```

Notice that ScopeFoundry Measurement class names always have the suffix "Measure".


Step 4: Run your App
---------------------------

Now that we have the basics of our app. We can open it, run our measurement and save some data.

Again, in your terminal window: `python fancy_microscope_app.py` and you will be greeted something like this:

![Image of microscope](microscope-with-func-gen.png)

In this graphical interface we do the following:

* Connect to hardware (here our `virtual_function_gen` hardware component)
    * Expand the `virtual_function_gen` section of the Hardware tree
    * Click the `connected` checkbox

* Configure the Hardware:
    * In the `virtual_function_gen` section of the Hardware tree, set the `amplitude`
* Choose Data save directory and sample meta data
    * In the App box or File menu, choose your data save directory. The default is the `data/` folder inside the App directory.
    * Sample name can be set in the App box in bottom left.
* Setup measurement conditions (How often we sample the data, if we are saving a data file)
    * Expand the `sine_wave_plot` section of the Measurements tree
    * adjust the `sampling_period` setting
* Run the measurement:
    * To start the measurement we can check the `activation` checkbox, or click on the `start` button.
    * Observe data flowing in! The plot on the right panel will update as data is acquired.
    * Stop the measurement via the `interrupt` button or unchecking `activation`


Step 5: Analyze Data
--------------------
[HDFView]: https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/
[HDF Group]: https://www.hdfgroup.org/
[h5py]: http://www.h5py.org
[FoundryDataBrowser]: https://github.com/ScopeFoundry/FoundryDataBrowser

The measurement will auto-save a data-file that contains the optimizer history to an HDF5 (.h5) data file within the specified Save Directory. This data file contains the data along with data structures that include all the meta-data from the microscope App. To view this data file, we can use a graphical viewer [HDFView], or use the [FoundryDataBrowser] from the ScopeFoundry project.

The [data file](./building_your_first_microscope_tutorial/1486144636_sine_wave_plot.h5) created by the `sine_wave_plot` measurement has the following hierarchy:

    |> app
        |- name = vfunc_gen_test_app
        |- ScopeFoundry_type = App
        |> settings
            |- save_dir = ~/fancy_microscope/data
            |- sample = Test Sample 42
            |> units
    |> hardware
        |- ScopeFoundry_type = HardwareList
        |> virtual_function_gen
            |- name = virtual_function_gen
            |- ScopeFoundry_type = Hardware
            |> settings
                |- connected = True
                |- debug_mode = False
                |- amplitude = 1.0
                |- rand_data = 0.5191185618096453
                |- sine_data = 0.9099735972719286
                |- square_data = -1.0
                |> units
    |> measurement
        |> sine_wave_plot
            |- name = sine_wave_plot
            |- ScopeFoundry_type = Measurement
            |D buffer: (120,) float64
            |> settings
                |- activation = False
                |- running = True
                |- progress = 50.0
                |- save_h5 = True
                |- sampling_period = 0.1
                |> units
                    |- progress = %
                    |- sampling_period = s

You will notice that this data file contains much more than just the sine wave data recorded during your measurement. It also contains all the settings of the hardware and measurement conditions at the time of the data acquisition. 


We can access this data file in Python using the [h5py] package.

```python
import h5py

dat = h5py.File('1486144636_sine_wave_plot.h5', 'r')

sample_name = dat['app/settings'].attrs['sample']
print(sample_name)
# Test Sample 42

buffer_data = dat['measurement/sine_wave_plot/buffer']

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.title(sample_name)
plt.plot( buffer_data)
plt.savefig('sine_wave_data_plot_42.png')
plt.show()
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have interacted with ScopeFoundry and built a microscope app with pre-built components, you probably would like to build a system that allows you to do real scientific experiements. To do this we need to build custom measurement types and potentially new hardware components for ScopeFoundry.

See these tutorials for a more detailed look into how to customize your microscope with ScopeFoundry: 

* ScopeFoundry [Key Concepts](key_concepts.md)
* Build a custom Measurement
* Build a custom [Hardware Component](building_a_custom_hardware_plugin.md)
* Build a custom [Data Browser View]((./databrowser_view_tutorial.md)) for your data files
* Create a custom side bar
