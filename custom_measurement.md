# Building a Custom Measurement

Here we discuss how to build a custom Measurement component for ScopeFoundry.

We will be describing how to build the `sine_wave_plot` measurement that is part of the [`virtual_function_gen`](http://github.com/ScopeFoundry/HW_virtual_function_gen/) ScopeFoundryHW package.

## Basic Structure

A ScopeFoundry Measurement is defined as a sub-class of `ScopeFoundry.Measurement` with a few methods (functions) defined that will describe how to setup up the measurement's data structures (`setup()`) and user interface (`setup_figure()`) as well as functions to define the Measurement procedure (`run()`) and display (`update_display()`). We will expand on each of these functions in the next few sections.


```python

from ScopeFoundry import Measurement

# Our measurement inherits from the ScopeFoundry Measurement class

class SineWavePlotMeasure(Measurement):
    
    # this is the name of the measurement that ScopeFoundry uses 
    # when displaying your measurement and saving data related to it    
    name = "sine_wave_plot"
    
    def setup(self):
        """
        Runs once during App initialization.
        This is the place to load a user interface file,
        define settings, and set up data structures. 
        """

    def setup_figure(self):
        """
        Runs once during App initialization, after setup()
        This is the place to make all graphical interface initializations,
        build plots, etc.
        """
    
    def run(self):
        """
        Runs when measurement is started. Runs in a separate thread from GUI.
        It should not update the graphical interface directly, and should only
        focus on data acquisition.
        """
        
    def update_display(self):
        """
        Displays (plots) the data
        This function runs repeatedly and automatically during the measurement run.
        its update frequency is defined by self.display_update_period
        """
```        

We add this Measurement to our MicroscopeApp by the app's `add_measurement()` method:

```python

class FancyMicroscopeApp(BaseMicroscopeApp):
    ...
    def setup(self):
        ...
        #Add Measurement components
        from ScopeFoundryHW.virtual_function_gen import SineWavePlotMeasure
        self.add_measurement(SineWavePlotMeasure(self))
        ...
```

## Measurement Settings

`setup()`

## Run()

`run()`

### Define measurement steps

### Saving data to disk

### Interrupting a measurement

## Build a user interface


![Qt Creator Interface](qt-creator-sine-plot-ui.png)


### Load ui in setup()
 loading to `setup()`

## Bringing user interface to life

`setup_figure()` and `update_display()`

### Connect graphical widgets to code

```python
    def setup_figure(self):
        ...
        # connect ui widgets to measurement/hardware settings or functions
        self.ui.start_pushButton.clicked.connect(self.start)
        self.ui.interrupt_pushButton.clicked.connect(self.interrupt)
        self.settings.save_h5.connect_to_widget(self.ui.save_h5_checkBox)
        self.func_gen.settings.amplitude.connect_to_widget(self.ui.amp_doubleSpinBox)
        ...
```

### Create PyQtGraph plots

```python
    def setup_figure(self):
        ...        
        # Set up pyqtgraph graph_layout in the UI
        self.graph_layout=pg.GraphicsLayoutWidget()
        self.ui.plot_groupBox.layout().addWidget(self.graph_layout)

        # Create PlotItem object (a set of axes)  
        self.plot = self.graph_layout.addPlot(title="Sine Wave Readout Plot")
        # Create PlotDataItem object ( a scatter plot on the axes )
        self.optimize_plot_line = self.plot.plot([0])        
        ...
```

### Update plots during run()

In order to see the data as it is aquired, an `update_display()` function is called repeatedly at an interval defined by `self.display_update_period` (in seconds). This value is set by default to 0.1 seconds, but can be updated in `setup_figure()`. 

Since we created all the plot objects during `setup_figure()` this `update_display()` function can be quite simple. Here we update the `optimze_plot_line` using the data in `self.buffer`, which is being filled by the Measurement `run()` thread.


```python
    def update_display(self):
        self.optimize_plot_line.setData(self.buffer) 
```
